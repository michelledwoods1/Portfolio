# Portfolio
## Description
Task: To create a web application,in the format of a portfolio page, to showcase my deployed work samples for review and assessment by potential employers.

I am required to apply the core skills learned in the course to date, including flexbox, media queries and CSS variables.

As the course progresses, I will continue to add to this portfolio page, to showcase my skills and talents.

By providing a portfolio, with several deployed applications, I am more likely to be successful in my career search upon completion of the course.
